# Handwritten Digits Recognition using TensorFlow

## Overview

This project focuses on building a handwritten digits recognition system using TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning library. The goal is to create a model that can accurately identify and classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Features

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** The model architecture is based on a Convolutional Neural Network, a powerful deep learning technique widely used in image recognition tasks.

- **MNIST Dataset:** The model is trained and tested on the MNIST dataset, a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9).

- **TensorFlow:** TensorFlow is used to build, train, and evaluate the deep learning model. It provides a flexible and efficient framework for creating and deploying machine learning models.
